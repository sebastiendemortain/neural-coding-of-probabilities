# neural-coding-of-probabilities
This contains the code related to my master thesis project about the characterization of neural coding of probabilities.

- main_activities.py : script giving some nice plots about neural activity for each coding schemes.
- main_cv.py : script running the multiple loop + the cross-validation, so far for simulation 1. 
- neural_proba.py : contains main classes and functions useful for sequential data importation, activity/BOLD conversion. 
- plot_hrf.py : sandbox to play with nistats modules. 
- utils.py : some functions collected online useful for general objects handling.
