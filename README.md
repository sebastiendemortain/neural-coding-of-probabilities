# neural-coding-of-probabilities
This contains the code related to my master thesis project about the characterization of neural coding of probabilities.

- main_activities.py : script giving some nice plots about neural activity for each coding schemes.
- main_cv.py : script running the cross-validation for simulation 1.
- main_feature _creation.py : parallelized script to make the design matrix X 
- neural_proba.py : contains main classes and functions useful for sequential data importation, activity/BOLD conversion. 
- plot_results.py : script allowing to plot results from simulations. 
- plot_hrf.py : sandbox to play with nistats modules. 
- utils.py : some functions collected online useful for general objects handling. 

The data shall be placed in the data/simu folders. One trivial run example is available here.
